# Task Manager Application

A simple application intended to leverage a back-end server hosting a generic CRUD API for data objects. The application offers the ability to create, update and delete a list of tasks, each task containing fields to describe the task, set it's priority and due date.

The primary purpose of the application development is to get hands on with the React framework, gaining familiarity with:

- JSX Syntax
- React state and event engine
- AJAX Queries with back-end service

```
npm i
```

```
npm start
```

Server will run on port 4247 by default (defined in src/server/config.js).
The back-end data server is configured to be on localhost:4242 (defined in src/server/config.js)

To interact with the application, load http://localhost:4247 in your browser.
